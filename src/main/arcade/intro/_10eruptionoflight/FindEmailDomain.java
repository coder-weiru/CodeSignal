/**
 An email address such as "John.Smith@example.com" is made up of a local part ("John.Smith"), an "@" symbol, then a domain part ("example.com").

 The domain name part of an email address may only consist of letters, digits, hyphens and dots. The local part, however, also allows a lot of different special characters. Here you can look at several examples of correct and incorrect email addresses.

 Given a valid email address, find its domain part.

 Example

 For address = "prettyandsimple@example.com", the output should be
 solution(address) = "example.com";
 For address = "fully-qualified-domain@codesignal.com", the output should be
 solution(address) = "codesignal.com".
