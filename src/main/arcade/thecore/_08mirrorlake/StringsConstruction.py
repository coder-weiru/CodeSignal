#
# Given two strings a and b, both consisting only of lowercase English letters, your task is to calculate
# how many strings equal to a can be constructed using only letters from the string b? Each letter can be
# used only once and in one string only.
#
# Example
#
# For a = "abc" and b = "abccba", the output should be solution(a, b) = 2.
#
# We can construct 2 strings a = "abc" using only letters from the string b.
#
# For a = "ab" and b = "abcbcb", the output should be solution(a, b) = 1.
#
# Input/Output
#
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
#
# [input] string a
#
# String to construct, containing only lowercase English letters.
#
# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ a.length â‰¤ 105.
#
# [input] string b
#
# String containing needed letters, containing only lowercase English letters.
#
# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ b.length â‰¤ 105.
#
# [output] integer
#
# The number of strings a that can be constructed from the string b.
