# A step(x) operation works like this: it changes a number x into x - s(x), where s(x) is the sum of x's digits.
# You like applying functions to numbers, so given the number n, you decide to build a decreasing sequence of
# numbers: n, step(n), step(step(n)), etc., with 0 as the last element.
#
# Building a single sequence isn't enough for you, so you replace all elements of the sequence with the sums of
# their digits (s(x)). Now you're curious as to which number appears in the new sequence most often. If there are
# several answers, return the maximal one.
#
# Example
#
# For n = 88, the output should be
# solution(n) = 9.
#
# Here is the first sequence you built: 88, 72, 63, 54, 45, 36, 27, 18, 9, 0;
# And here is s(x) for each of its elements: 16, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 0.
# As you can see, the most frequent number in the second sequence is 9.
#
# For n = 8, the output should be
# solution(n) = 8.
#
# At first you built the following sequence: 8, 0
# s(x) for each of its elements is: 8, 0
# As you can see, the answer is 8 (it appears as often as 0, but is greater than it).
#
# Input/Output
#
# [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)
#
# [input] integer n
#
# Guaranteed constraints:
# 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 105.
#
# [output] integer
#
# The most frequent number in the sequence s(n), s(step(n)), s(step(step(n))), etc.
